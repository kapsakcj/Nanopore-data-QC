# Nanopore-data-QC
R code for generating Q-score and read length histograms

This repo contains  ugly and old R code that I used to generate some nice R plots for my MS thesis. Not my finest work, but it was one of my first experiences using git/github so I've kept it on my list of repo's.

Please do not bother trying to use the code. There are much better tools out there for plotting Nanopore data stats like - https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot
